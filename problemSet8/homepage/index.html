                I’m Rishi, a B.Tech student in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and
                Machine Learning. I enjoy understanding how things work at a fundamental level, whether it’s an
                algorithm, a data structure, or a system design decision. For me, programming is not just about writing
                code—it’s about building logic and clarity.
            </p>
            <p class = "home_p">
                I have experience with C++, Python, and core computer science subjects such as Data Structures and
                Algorithms, Operating Systems, and Computer Organization. I’ve participated in and won coding
                competitions at my college, and I actively practice problem-solving to sharpen my thinking. Currently,
                I’m strengthening my foundations through courses like CS50 while exploring machine learning alongside
                web development.
            </p>
            <p class = "home_p">
                My goal is to build meaningful projects that reflect both strong fundamentals and practical impact. I’m
                especially interested in how software can solve real-world problems efficiently and elegantly. This site
                is a small step toward documenting my journey, sharing what I learn, and showcasing what I build.
